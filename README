                             -=-= What's New =-=-

The MysticBBS Multi Tool, usually called mystmult, is what I like to call
a swiss-army knife for the MysticBBS sysop. There are many functions this 
program does, which is beneficial to the sysop.

If you are running MTAFile file announcement, you will already have the
rcs.ini file. This program uses the same rcs.ini file to obtain information
about your system, and how you would like the reports to be shown.

                             -=-= Description =-=-

mystmult can perform many different functions for the MysticBBS sysop. The
first function it was capable of, is performing a backup of all the log files
within the /mystic/logs directory. The format of the backup logs are in the
format of:

/mystic/logs/2019/04/28/

mystmult, when this function is called, will create, if needed, the year,
month, and day folder for the previous days log files, and copy all of the
logs into that folder. These logs are not compressed or renamed, just copied.
This is important, as other functions and other programs will use these log
files to obtain information.

The reports that can be generated by mystmult include the following:
Detailed Echo Report
  Can be sorted by incoming message count, outbound message count, duplicate
  message count, message network, or echo name.
Detailed Node Report (incoming and outgoing message count, size, connections)
List of other networks, based on aka's shown by other systems.
List of mailers used, based on connecting systems.

                       -=-= Warranties and Guarantees =-=-

While every effort is made to make sure this program does what it is designed
to, and not harm your computer, the only warranty you have, is this program 
will take up space on your hard drive. Other than that, I assume no 
reponsibility for what happens to your computer due to the use of this 
software. 

If you do notice a bug in the program, or have a suggestion on how it could
be improved, please feel free to let me know.

                            -=-= Installation =-=-

mystmult uses the same config file as many of the other RCS programs. While
this file does look a bit overwhelming at first, it is actually quite simple
to use.

The file is documented, so you shouldn't have any problems with it. Each line
that starts with the ";" is ignored, and considered a comment. Keep in mind,
that not all of the information in this config is used for mystmult. 

mystmult should be placed in my /mystic directory, along with the rcs.ini
file. The log file will be created in your /mystic/logs directory, or 
wherever you indicate you would like them in the rcs.ini file. The reports,
at least at this time, will be created in the /mystic directory. These 
reports will be overwritten each time the program is run in that particular
mode, so make sure you do something with them! :)

If you run mystmult with no parameters, you will see a help screen. It looks
like this at the moment:

RCS MysticBBS Multi Tool 2.0.0.0

Command Line Parameters:
 L   - Perform Log Backup
 E#  - Create Detailed Echo Report
       Sort Echo Report by:
       1 - Incoming Message count
       2 - Message Network
       3 - Duplicate Message count
       4 - Outbound Message count
       5 - Echo Name
 N   - Create Detailed Node Report
 T   - Generate a list of other networks
 M   - Generate a list of mailers used to connect
 D   - Number of day of information on reports
 H   - This help file :)

Example...   Linux/64:
./mystmult D7 N E1 L T M
     This will run all five modes while sorting the echo report
     by the number of incoming messages, and report will contain
     7 days of information.

The example shown on this screen will show the OS that it was compiled
for. For example, the Windows compile shows:

Example...   Windows/32:
mystmult.exe D7 N E1 L T M

Log Backup:

To perform the log backup function of mystmult, just run with the parameter
of 'L'. For example: mystmult L

This will copy all of the log files into the directory structure as shown 
above. This funtion is extremely helpful if your system is running as a 
hub for a network. MysticBBS has a tendancy to create some HUGE logfiles.
On the fsxNet hub 4 system, I have had days where the mis.log files, which
are set to 1 Mb each, can be up to mis.5.log, and the fidopoll can easily 
be as large as 7 or 8 Mb, in one day. You can see how these log files can
easily get out of control.

Detailed Echo Report

To generate the detailed echo report, which will show how many incoming, 
outgoing and dupe messages there are in each message echo, you just need
to run with the 'E#' command. The # is how you would like the report to be
sorted.

Running with this parameter will generate a report file called echorpt.rpt
which will look something like:

One thing to keep in mind, if you would like to have this report sorted in
multiple ways, say by incoming and one by outgoing, you will need to run one
way, then process the file, then run again for the other sort method. The 
program, at this time, will overwrite the file each time it's run. Perhaps
some type of rename within a script could be used.

With this function, you have the ability to exclude echos from being displayed.
For example, I have my netmail excluded, along with a few of the admin echos
that I'm connected to. This way, they are not displayed for the public to see.

There is also the ability to exclude a network from being displayed in the
reports. I have a network setup on my systems, that is primarily used for 
testing functionality between systems. As I don't want these connections used
for reporting, they are excluded from the reports. Handy, isn't it? ;)

Detailed Node Connection Report

In order to generate the detailed node report, you would need to use the 
parameter of 'N', when running mystmult. This report contains incoming/
outgoing message count, incoming/outgoing file size, number of connections,
and which network the node is connecting with.

Here is a shortened version of what this report contains:

List of other Networks

The next function that mystmult will be able to do, is compile a list of
other networks, from information sent by connecting systems. This is still
a work in progress and may cause errors when trying to run...

List of Mailers

This function is also a work in progress. It will display a list of mailers
that have connected to the system. It also may cause errors when trying 
to run...

Number of days for reports

This is not fully implemented yet. It will allow you to chose how many days
you would like included in the generated reports.
